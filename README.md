Just an American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech :v:

I love stories, especially the science-fiction and fantasy genres. My goal is to one day write the script for a comic, join the writer's room for a TV series, or do narrative design for a game.

These days I'm particularly interested in anything that helps me understand myself and the world better, including psychology, physiology, cosmology, astrophysics, history, astrology, and wellness practices.

Hobbies include music, ultimate frisbee, dance, and gaming.
