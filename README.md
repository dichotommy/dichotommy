Just an American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech :v:

I love stories, especially the science-fiction and fantasy genres. My career goal is to one day write the script for a comic, join the writer's room for a TV series, or do narrative design for a game. Personally, though, I believe that stories can do much more than just entertain, and my deepest ambition is to create a story that changes the world for the better.

These days I'm particularly interested in anything that helps me understand myself and the world better, including psychology, physiology, cosmology, astrophysics, history, astrology, and wellness practices.

Hobbies include music 🪘 ultimate frisbee 🥏 dance 🕺 and gaming 🎮
