### Oh, a traveler! 🌳🌲🌳🌲🧙‍♂️🔥🌳🌲🌳🌲

We don't get too many like you in these parts.

Oh no, I do not mean that you are unwelcome.

Merely unexpected.

Come, lay down your sword.

If you find it within you to indulge an old man, I would recount a few tales of my youth.

You see, I have been called by many names.

- writer (technical/content/narrative/poetry) :writing_hand:
- ~~gamer~~ game designer/developer ♟️ :video_game:
- expat (in other words, an immigrant from a fancy country) 🇺🇸 🇧🇪 🇫🇷
- lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

But these days, I manage MeiliSearch's [documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) :book:

But what of you, traveler?

What purpose brings you to this GitHub profile?

What dark force has driven you so far, into these woods without name? 🌳🌲🌳🌲🌳🌲🌳🌲
