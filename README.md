### Oh, hello traveler! 🧙‍♂️

We don't get too many like you in these parts. The night is cold. Come, lay down your sword and rest by the fire.

Me? There's not much to say. But if you would indulge an old man, I could recount a few tales of my youth. You see, I have been called by many names.

- writer (technical/content/narrative/poetry) :writing_hand:
- ~~gamer~~ game designer/developer ♟️ :video_game:
- expat (in other words, an immigrant from a fancy country) 🇺🇸 🇧🇪 🇫🇷
- lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

But these days, I manage MeiliSearch's [documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) :book:

But what of you, traveler? What dark purpose brings you to this GitHub profile? What heinous deeds have you committed to come so far, into these woods without name?
