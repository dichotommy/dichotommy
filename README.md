### Oh, hello! :raising_hand_man: I almost didn't see you there! :see_no_evil:

I don't know what brings you to my humble profile, but I hope you enjoy your stay.
While you're getting settled, why don't I tell you a little bit about myself?
I am:
- a writer :writing_hand:
- a ~~gamer~~ game developer :video_game:
- a lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

I use this account to
- learn more about web development :spider_web: especially with the React framework
- contribute to MeiliSearch's fabulous documentation :book:
