Just an American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech 🤓✌️

I love stories, especially genre-smashing speculative fiction. I hope one day to write the script for a sports manga about ultimate frisbee, join the writer's room for a sci-fi series, or do narrative design for an indie game. I believe that stories can do much more than just entertain, and my deepest ambition is to help bring life to stories that change our world for the better.

These days I'm particularly interested in anything that helps me understand this universe and my place in it, including psychology, physiology, cosmology, physics, history, astrology, and wellness practices.

Hobbies include drumming 🪘 ultimate frisbee 🥏 tango 🕺 and gaming 🎮
