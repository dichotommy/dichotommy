An American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech. My happy place is somewhere at the intersection of stories, systems, and psychology. I want to use stories to spread powerful ideas that have a positive social impact.

These days I'm interested in anything that helps me understand this universe and my place in it. You can find me reading about the latest quantum gravity theories or writing about my life over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@tommymelvin).

Hobbies include tango 💃 ultimate frisbee 🥏 and physics :atom:
