### Oh, hello! :raising_hand_man: I almost didn't see you there! :see_no_evil:

I don't know what brings you to my humble profile, but I hope you enjoy your stay.

While you're getting settled, why don't I tell you a little bit about myself?

I am:
- a writer (technical/content/narrative/poetry) :writing_hand:
- an expat ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· (note: "expat" means "immigrant", but fancier ğŸ˜¬)
- a ~~gamer~~ game designer :video_game:
- a lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

I mainly use this account to manage MeiliSearch's fabulous [documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) :book:
