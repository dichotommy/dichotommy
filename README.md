An American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech 💁

I love stories, systems, psychology, and efficiency.

I dream about doing narrative and game design for an indie game, writing on an (actually decent) Netflix series, or, my secret desire 🤫 writing the script for a sports manga about ultimate frisbee.

I believe that stories can do much more than just entertain, and my deepest ambition is to use stories to spread powerful beneficial ideas and shape our world for the better.

These days I'm particularly interested in anything that helps me understand this universe and my place in it, including everything from astronomy to astrology. You can catch me reading about the latest quantum gravity theories on Wikipedia or writing about my life over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@tommymelvin).

Hobbies include drumming 🪘 ultimate frisbee 🥏 tango 🕺 and gaming 🎮
