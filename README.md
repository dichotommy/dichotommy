### Oh, hello traveler! :raising_hand_man:

We don't get too many like you in these parts. Come, lay down your sword and warm yourself by the fire—as a treat, I'll even tell you a little bit about myself. I am known to some as a:

- writer (technical/content/narrative/poetry) :writing_hand:
- ~~gamer~~ game designer/developer ♟️ :video_game:
- expat (AKA an immigrant, but from a fancy country) 🇺🇸 🇧🇪 🇫🇷
- lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

But these days, I use this account to manage MeiliSearch's [documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) :book:

But what of you, traveler? What dark purpose brings you to this GitHub profile? What heinous deeds have you committed to come so far, into these woods without name?
