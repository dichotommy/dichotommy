An American writer/editor living in Europe and working in tech. My happy place is somewhere in the intersection of stories, systems, psychology, and efficiency.

Goals for the future:
- Do narrative and game design for an indie game
- Join the writer's room on a sci-fi series
- Write a hot-blooded sports manga about ultimate frisbee

Stories can do so much more than just entertain! My deepest ambition is to use stories to spread powerful ideas that have a positive social impact.

These days I'm interested in anything that helps me understand this universe and my place in it—everything from astronomy to astrology. You can catch me reading about the latest quantum gravity theories on Wikipedia or writing about my life over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@tommymelvin).

Hobbies include drumming 🪘 ultimate frisbee 🥏 tango 🕺 gaming 🎮 and armchair science of all varieties 🧪
