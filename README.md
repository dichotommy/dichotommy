### Oh, a traveler! 🧙‍♂️

We don't get too many like you in these parts. Oh no, I do not mean that you are unwelcome. Merely unexpected. Come, lay down your sword and rest by the fire.

Me? There's not much to say. But if you would indulge an old man, I could recount a few tales of my youth. You see, I have been called by many names.

- writer (technical/content/narrative/poetry) :writing_hand:
- ~~gamer~~ game designer/developer ♟️ :video_game:
- expat (in other words, an immigrant from a fancy country) 🇺🇸 🇧🇪 🇫🇷
- lover of organized and disorganized sounds :drum: :headphones:

But these days, I manage MeiliSearch's [documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation) :book:

But what of you, traveler? What purpose brings you to this GitHub profile? What dark force has driven you so far, into these woods without name?
